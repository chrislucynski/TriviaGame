# TriviaGame

###What the project does:

This is a Trivia game about me.  The loading screen has a start button to start the trivia game.  Once pressed, it begins displaying the trivia questions one at a time.  As the user guesses (or let's time run out), the correct answers are displayed in green, and the incorrect guesses are displayed in red. After 4 seconds, the next question is shown, and the answering begins again. 

Once the last question is answered, you are presented with your correct and incorrect guesses, as well as how many questions you ran out of time on. If you want to try the game again, you can click the retry button, which cycles through the questions again. 

###Why the project is useful:

This project includes HTML, CSS, and JS. The JS incudes timers, click functions, and DOM changes.
